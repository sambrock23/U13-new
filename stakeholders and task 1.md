## fixing various formatting  issues 

* I have moved the carousel so it isn,t spread across the page and 
* I have moved the paragraphs away from the margin so I can see the word abit more easily.
* I spaced out my words so they are not all on top of each other.

Yes I have achieved the stackholders requirement as 

* The webpage promotes the sale of all required elements: phones, accessories and services but the main target is selling Mobile phones. 
* The webpage loads within seconds, navigation is made easy because it is multi linked, there are at least 8 linked pages and 1 table as requested 
* The colour scheme is consistant throughoutas are the page&text style. 
* The webpage contains: digital video, audio,animations and digital graphics by using a carousel,a youtube on how to unbox a phone,image that uses jpeg/png.
* The webpage contains a customer contact form as an interact feature. 
* Hyperlinks are provided to other siters such as youtube to enhance the customer experience and provided pratical support.
* The webpage has numerous internal links which are all responsive and easy to us. 
* The Webpage works easily on all platforms such as PC,Ipad and Mobile Phones.


## finalised

I had positive feedback from other students in the class which they thought the colour scheme was nice however in the next version of the website I will change the carousel so that the arrows work on the carousel aswell as the nav bar at the bottom of it. Also, I will change the images as they are a low quality, and I will look at the different window size so it will open to half the window and full window, and I will look at getting the paragraphs less stretched. But what Iâ€™m not going to do is add link into the sites (e.g: what we sell and the phone table) because I thought the table went well with the colour scheme and it give the information well in a table than using a link to a website.
