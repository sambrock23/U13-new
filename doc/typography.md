(https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen)
# I have choosen the oxygen font, it is easy to read for all. The font syle has soft edges so it is aesthetically pleasing to the reader. "Oxygen"works  well in all graphical user interfaces, desktops and devices.I have decided to have regular 400 as my style. 

## Second Font Style 
(https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Overpass)
# For my second choice of font I have choosen the overpass font because it is easy to read  and really stands out and keeps the attention of the reader. This font works especially in smaller sizes on-screen and later for display sizes, especially in the lighter weights.I have decied to have extra-light 200 as my style.
