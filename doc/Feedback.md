**Ace** - The colour scheme is very nice on the eyes. Home page is pretty empty and the carousel only works through clicking the bottom nav bars but not the arrows. The images are low quality and crop is rough.

The help page is very well written out and developed and has a lot of information.

The about page is crowded and has a lot of different information that could use its own web page such as the 'what we sell' and the phone table.

The contact us page doesn't load in from the home page but does from the rest. 

The site doesn't work in different window sizes, only having one set position, when looking at the site in a half-window, the company name is cut off and the text on the help page gets positioned oddly.


**Adam** - The colour scheme is very nice and i really like the colours. The Contact us bottom is also working really well and the interactivity is also really good. The images on the website are a little pixelated but overall they are easily reconizable, On the homepage image at the top the screen if your going to make it an image you wanna try and make sure the text isnt a little bit streached like it currently is. overall i really like the website and there isnt many things to change. 



During my testing I found that the navigation Bar wasn'working, this is how I fixed it by changing the code so it linked up to the other webpages.
During my testing I found that the paragraphs were too close towards the margin, this is how I fixed it by resizing my magins so the text was too close. 
During my testing I found that the images were not in the correct aspect ratio, this is how I fixed it by resizing the images to a suitable aspect ratio.
